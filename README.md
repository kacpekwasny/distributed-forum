No action can be undone. No deleting, no editing, no unliking. What done is done. Think twice.

Self hosted forum with reddit like structure.
- history - a server
  - age - a subreddit
    - story - a post in an age
      - answer - a comment to a story, also answers to answers are possible
  - users - a history has users,

Distributed.
- you may browse other histories,
- you may post to other histories if the history you are browsing from is peered with that history
  ex.: on your browser you have opened history `brows.com`, your user is registered @ `reg.com`,  you are browsing an *age* from `age.com`. You may post a *story* to that *age* if `brows.com <-> age.com` and `age.com <-> reg.com`, where `<->` meens a peer connection.
- if you browse `a.com` from `brows.com`, then every post, answer coming retrived from `a.com` will be saved at `brows.com`. Thanks to **no-undo** policy, those posts never expire, and will never be deleted from the internet.
